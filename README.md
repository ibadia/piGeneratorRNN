# piGeneratorRNN

This is a small experiment in which i tried to generate the suceeding value of pi using the preeceding values.
E.g: pi=3.14159265359........

We can easily generate the dataset from this using this simple logic
Query   Result
141     5
415     9
159     2
592     6
926     5

We can easily generate a dataset from this.
This is done using the 1 billion pi values at https://stuff.mit.edu/afs/sipb/contrib/pi/

We can make the query bigger in a wish to obtain the logic.
